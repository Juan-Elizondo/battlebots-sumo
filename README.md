# auto-sumo
autonomous 3kg sumo

NOTES:
There was not enough time to test the final implementation before competition, and a number of problems presented themselves there.
1. Line sensors not sensitive enough:
No replacements, sensors low to ground in first place
2. Ultrasonic sensors were of very low quality:
Look into buying better ones or using IR range sensors
3. Motors would not run simultaneously in search:
Strangely, they would run together in recovery() and follow()
More investigation is needed
    
Results: To be notified
